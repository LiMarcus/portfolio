I use [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io) to let my Node.js running  forever

Here are some commonds:

**Install:**  `npm install pm2 -g`

**Setup:** 

```
pm2 start app.js
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

**Check log:** `pm2 log`

**Kill:** `pm2 kill`

**Remove:** `npm remove pm2 -g`

Today, I meet a mistake: status in  the pm2  is "errored" <br/>
Spent a lot of time then figure out that my catch(error){} forgot to add "error"" parameter, my node.js didn't find this error and compile successfully, but it can't running on pm2
