**1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points** <br/>
On a plane there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points. <br/>

You can move according to the next rules: <br/>

* In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or diagonally (it means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second).
* You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]   
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds
```

**Solution:**

```java

class Solution {
    public int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(int[][] points) {
        // path goes diagonally first, then go vertically or horizontally
        // the time is same with goes longest vertically or horizontally
        int x = points[0][0], y = points[0][1], len = 0;
        for( int a = 1; a < points.length; a++){
            int xx = Math.abs(points[a][0] - x);
            int yy = Math.abs(points[a][1] - y);    
            if( xx - yy > 0) len += xx;
            else len += yy;
            
            x = points[a][0];
            y = points[a][1];
        }
        
        return len;
    }
}
```
