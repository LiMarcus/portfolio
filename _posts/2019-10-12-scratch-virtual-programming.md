In Scratch, all programming logical lanaguage are blocks. User can drag blocks and pull them inside the  frame. 
Scratch also have "If...else", but it use "forever" instead of "while(true)". Scratch can improve young children ability of sloving problem, which makes people think problem well-organized.
But it also has some disadvantage compare to the real coding, Scratch using "clone" to create same object reaptedly, which we must create new object by "new class()", we can't create new object by copy itself. The object in Scratch looks like prototype in JS, which one prototype can be inherited by others.
