**Three Principles:**
1. Single source of truth: <br/>
			* 	Easy to create universal apps; <br/>
			* 	A single state tree make it easier to debug or inspect;
2. State is read-only <br/>
			* 	Only way to change is (1) action : an object describing what happened
3. Changes are made with pure functions<br/>
			* Reducer: just pure functions that take previous state and action, and return the next state;<br/>
			* Reducer can be split during the app grows, which manage specific parts of state tree;<br/>
			* Reducer is just function, we can control the order of call, add additional part or reusable;

**How to use React & Redux together?**

1. In top-level components, we set Redux state as components state;<br/>
			* When state change, use setState to trigger a re-render;
2. We can break top-level components to smaller components;<br/>
			* Passing Redux states as React props to create small components;<br/>
			* The sub-components not directly related to Redux, because their behavior determined by props;
3. top-level components: Smart components
4. sub components: Dumb components
5. "connect" function in React-Redux hooks together the Redux states and Smart components;

**How React and Redux talk to each other?**

1. We need let app know Redux store exist:<br/>
			* use "Provider" in react-redux library;<br/>
			* only one purpose: to "provide" the store to child components;<br/>
			* if want entire app to access store,  put <App/> in Provider;
			
			<Provider store={store}>
				<App/>
			</Provider>, document.getElementById('app-node'))
