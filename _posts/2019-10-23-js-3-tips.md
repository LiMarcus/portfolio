Follow the [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0QTqHXiVNw), learn 3 new stuffs

**Call back **

Example 1

```js
	Const sayName = (name, cb) => {
		console.log('running some code');
		console.log(`My name is ${name}`);
		cb();
	}
	
	function callback(){
		console.log('This ran at the end');
	}
	
	sayName('Ed', callback);
	
	//result:
	//running some code
	//My name is Ed
	//This ran at the end
```

Example 2:

```js
consloe.log('first');

setTimeout(() => {
	console.log('from callback');
}, 2000);

console.log('last');

//Result:
//first
//last
//from callback
```

Explain:

**Call stack** : 

Defination from[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack): 
Mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of multiple functions 
* When script calls a function, the interpreter add it to the call stack
* The function that are called by a function, will add on the top of stack
* If have two much funciton in stack and run out of space, it result "stack verflow" 


**Web APIs** 

* Web APIs dont go to stack
* There are large unmber of Web APIs, setTimeout is one of them,  it count down the umber and invoke the functions, put functions back to call stack.
* Everything in Web APIs is running asynchronous

**Callback Queue**

The invoked Web APIs store in callbakc queue, wait until call stack is empty, no other functions need go to stack, then send functions to call stack.
