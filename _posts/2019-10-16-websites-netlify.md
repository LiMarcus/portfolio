I post a demo website on Netlify today, Netlify is a free hosting for beginners who want to host a small website front end. Let me explain why it is suitable for beginners:

**Advantages:**

* Free for website hosting;
* Pull and drop local folder to deploy website;
* Can link Git repository;
* Follow the step, easy to find a cutom domain;
* Secured automatically with Let's Encryt certificate;
* Easy to do asset optimization: URLs, CSS, JS, Images
* Have prerendering function;
* Analytics: It charge $9/month, I did use this function, so I can not give feed back to compare with Google Analytics;
* Using Identity function to deploy user login and register quickly;
